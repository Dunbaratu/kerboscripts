### A repository for scripts for use with the kOS mod of KSP.

The scripts you see here are meant to be used with the kOS mod of
Kerbal Space Program, ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/ ).

### Branch layout.

``master``:
    Where everything gets checked in-to eventually.  I will attempt to restrict
    the content of 'master' to be only that which would work with the public
    release of kOS (in-develop things won't go here, unless I screw up).
    This will be the default branch of the github project for Stock playing.

``realism_overhaul``::
    Where I will check in changes specifically for realism overhaul that I
    don't want to place into the master branch just yet.  In my RO playthrough
    I'm finding many tweaks to my scripts I'm having to make that I don't know
    if they really make sense to put into the stock versions of the scripts
    or not.  They go here.

``develop``:
    If I want to check in something that works, but only if you use the develop
    build of kOS and not the public release, I'll temporarily store it here.
    Unlike with the kOS project itself, I won't use this as the github's default
    branch.

``twitchYYYYMMDD``:
    These will be "tags" for releases, that I will use for the state the scripts
    were in at the end of an episode of my twitch streaming.
