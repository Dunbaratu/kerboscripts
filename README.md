### A repository for scripts for use with the kOS mod of KSP.

The scripts you see here are meant to be used with the kOS mod of
Kerbal Space Program, ( http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/ ).

### Branch layout.

``master``:
    Where everything gets checked in-to eventually.  I will attempt to restrict
    the content of 'master' to be only that which would work with the public
    release of kOS (in-develop things won't go here, unless I screw up).
    This will be the default branch of the github project.

``develop``:
    If I want to check in something that works, but only if you use the develop
    build of kOS and not the public release, I'll temporarily store it here.
    Unlike with the kOS project itself, I won't use this as the github's default
    branch.

``twitchYYYYMMDD``:
    These will be "tags" for releases, that I will use for the state the scripts
    were in at the end of an episode of my twitch streaming.
