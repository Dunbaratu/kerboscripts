// A dumb script to orbit, designed to be simple.
// made during twitch stream.

// SHIP DESIGN RULES TO USE THIS SCRIPT::
//
// 1 - LAUNCH CLAMPS - If you have launch clamps, set them up so
//     they let go as the first stage starts (same item in staging list).
// 2 - PAYLOAD_CUT_PE - Set variable in this script: "payload_cut_pe" to the 
//     height you want to detach any parts you'd like to de-orbit just before
//     finishing circularizing.
// 3 - TAG NAMES THAT MEAN SOMETHING:
//     3.1 - "fairing" : Any part tagged "fairing" with ModuleProceduralFairing
//           in it, will be "Deploy"ed when Pe hits payload_cut_pe.
//     3.2 - "payload cutoff" : Any part tagged "payload cutoff" is assumed to
//           be in the "launcher" part of the rocket that must be staged away
//           just before finishing circularlization.  At "payload_cut_pe", the
//           script will stage until all the "payload_cutoff" parts have been
//           detached.  (i.e. tag the decoupler just under the payload with this name).
